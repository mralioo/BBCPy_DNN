This database includes the de-identified EEG data from 62 healthy individuals who participated in a brain-computer interface (BCI) study. All subjects underwent 7-11 sessions of BCI training which involves controlling a computer cursor to move in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spaces using subject’s “intent”. EEG data were recorded with 62 electrodes. In addition to the EEG data, behavioral data including the online success rate of BCI cursor control are also included.

This dataset was collected under support from the National Institutes of Health via grants AT009263, EB021027, NS096761, MH114233, RF1MH to Dr. Bin He.

This dataset has been used and analyzed to study the learning of BCI control and the effects of mind-body awareness training on this process. The results are reported in: Stieger et al, “Mindfulness Improves Brain Computer Interface Performance by Increasing Control over Neural Activity in the Alpha Band,” Cerebral Cortex, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa234).
